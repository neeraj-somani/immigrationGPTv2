## 🆘 Troubleshooting & Support

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### 🚨 Backend Issues

**Problem**: `ModuleNotFoundError` when running backend
```bash
# Solution: Install dependencies properly
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
# OR with uv (recommended)
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Problem**: `Port 8000 already in use`
```bash
# Solution: Kill existing process or use different port
lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill -9
# OR modify main.py to use different port
```

**Problem**: API key validation fails
```bash
# Solution: Check your .env file format
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-key-here
TAVILY_API_KEY=tvly-your-actual-key-here
# Make sure there are no spaces around the = sign
```

#### 🚨 Frontend Issues

**Problem**: `npm install` fails
```bash
# Solution: Clear cache and reinstall
npm cache clean --force
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

**Problem**: Frontend can't connect to backend
```bash
# Solution: Check .env.local file
echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000" > .env.local
# Make sure backend is running on port 8000
```

**Problem**: Build errors in production
```bash
# Solution: Check for TypeScript errors
npm run build
# Fix any type errors before deployment
```

#### 🚨 Analysis.ipynb Issues

**Problem**: Jupyter notebook won't start
```bash
# Solution: Install Jupyter
pip install jupyter
# OR with uv
uv pip install jupyter
```

**Problem**: API key prompts in notebook
```bash
# Solution: Set environment variables before starting Jupyter
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
export COHERE_API_KEY="your-key"
export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY="your-key"
jupyter notebook
```

**Problem**: Import errors in notebook
```bash
# Solution: Make sure you're in the project root directory
cd immigrationGPTv2
# The notebook expects to be run from the project root
```

### 🔍 Debugging Tips

1. **Check Logs**: Look at both frontend and backend console output
2. **API Key Validation**: Use the "Validate Keys" button in the UI
3. **Network Issues**: Ensure both services are running on correct ports
4. **Dependencies**: Make sure all packages are installed correctly
5. **Environment Variables**: Verify .env files are properly configured

### 📞 Getting Help

If you encounter issues not covered here:

2. Review the Analysis.ipynb for performance insights
3. Consult Report-qna.md for detailed project information
4. Verify your API keys are correct and have sufficient credits
5. Ensure all dependencies are installed and up to date
6. Check the console for detailed error messages

### 🎯 Performance Optimization

If you're experiencing slow performance:

1. **Use BM25 Retrieval**: Fastest method (1.76s response time)
2. **Enable Caching**: Results are cached for repeated queries
3. **Optimize Chunk Size**: Default 1000 tokens works well for most cases
4. **Monitor Costs**: Use LangSmith to track API usage and costs
